# Digit Classification Model using MNIST Database
![Alt text](Screenshot from 2024-03-15 15-42-28.png)

This project implements a digit classification model using a simple neural network with the Sequential API and the MNIST database. The model architecture consists of an input layer with 784 (28x28) nodes, followed by two hidden layers with 512 and 256 nodes, both using the ReLU activation function. The output layer has 10 nodes, representing the digits 0-9, without any activation function specified, making it suitable for multi-class classification.
